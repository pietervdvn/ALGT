{- 
Tests a given property against the given parsetrees.
More of a check for the property in other words!

If the predicates are met, we test wether the conclusion holds too

{- If a predicate fails, a 'failed predicate proof' is returned (by Left).
 If all succeed, these are returned.
Note that assignments are proven left to right, as a predicate on the left might introduce variables
Also, introduced variables might be used multiple times (implying equal terms). If these terms turn out not to be the same, a 'Failed Predicate' Proof is returned as well
