### Domain and codomain

It'll come in handy later on to be able to calculate the _domain_ and _codomain_ of a function type.
The _domain_ of a function is the type it can handle as input.
The _codomain_ of a function is the type it gives as output.

:Examples of domain and codomain

Function type		dom		cod
-------------		-----		-----
`Int -> Bool`		`Int`		`Bool`
`(Int -> Bool)`		`Int`		`Bool`
`Int -> Bool -> Bool`	`Int`		`Bool -> Bool`
`Int -> (Bool -> Bool)`	`Int`		`Bool -> Bool`
`(Int -> Bool) -> Bool`	`Int -> Bool`	`Bool -> Bool`
`Int`			_Undefined_	_Undefined_
`Bool`			_Undefined_	_Undefined_


Now, let's define these functions!

### The function section

We add a new header to _STFL.language_:

$$STFL.language![30..32]!file

In this function section, we can define the function _dom_ in the following way:

$$STFL.language!34,37!file

So, what is going on here? Let's first take a look to the first line:

$$STFL.language!34!file

The `domain` is the name of the function. The `type -> type` indicates what syntactic form is taken as input (a `type`) before the `->` and what is given as output (again a `type`). 

[^ISMETA]: You probably noticed the similarity between the types declared in our own STFL and this declaration. This is intentional.

### Pattern matching

Let's have look at the body of the function:

$$STFL.language!37!file

What happens if we throw in `Int -> Bool`? Remember that this is parsed as a tree, with three leafs. Notice that there are three elements in the pattern match to: a variable `T1`, a literal `->` and a variable `T2`. These leafs are matched respectively:

![Pattern matching in action](TypeTrees0annot.png){width=100%}


The same principle applies with more advanced inputs:

![Pattern matching in action (more advanced)](TypeTrees1annot.png){width=100%}


We thus always bind `T1` to the part before the top-level `->`, in other words: we always bind the input type (or domain type) to `T1`. As that is exactly what we need, we return it!

### Missing cases

This already gives us the most important part. However, what should we do if the first argument type is a function? e.g. `(Int -> Bool) -> Bool`:

![Typetree of function argument](TypeTrees2.png){width=50%}

This will match the pattern `T1 "->" T2` as following:

![Typetree of function argument, matched](TypeTrees2annot.png){width=50%}

We see that `T1` includes the `(` and `)`, which we don't want. We simply solve this by adding a extra clause:


$$STFL.language!34,36,37!file

We expect that the part _before_ the arrow now is surrounded by parens. Note that we put parens once without double quotes and once with. These parens capture this part of the parsetree and match it against the patterns inside the parens, as visible in the green ellipse:

![Recursive pattern matching](TypeTrees2annot1.png){width=50%}

### Recursion

There is a last missing case, namely if the entire type is wrapped in parens.

We match a type between parens, and then calculate its domain simply by calling the domain function again.

$$STFL.language![34..37]!file


### Clause determination

As you can see, there are two clauses now. How do we now what clause is executed?

Simply put, when the function is evaluated, the arguments are pattern matched against the first clause. If this pattern match succeeds, the expression on the right hand side is returned. Do the arguments not match the patterns? Then the next clause is considered. 

In other words, clauses are tried **from top to bottom** and tested. The first clause of which the patterns match, is executed.

When no clauses match, an error message is given.

### Executing functions

Let's put this to a test. We can calculate the domain of our examples.

Create a file `typeExamples.stfl`, with contents

$$typeExamples.stfl!file

Run this with `ALGT STFL.language typeExamples.stfl type -l -f domain`:

$$($$STFL.language![1..37] $$typeExamples.stfl type -l -f domain)

What does this output tell?

For starters, we get a warning that we forgot two cases, namely `Bool` and `Int`. For some functions this is a problem, but domain is not defined for those values. Note that a bunch of other tests are builtin as well.[^disabledTests]

[^disabledTests]: We'll silently ignore these warnings for the rest of the tutorial with flag `--no-checks`

Then, we see an overview for each function what result it gives (or an error message if the pattern matches failed).

If you want more information about the behaviour of a function, specify `--ia` or `--ifa FUNCTION-TO-ANALYZE` to get a clause-per-clause overview:

$$($$STFL.language![1..37] --ifa domain)![7..]


### Codomain

`codomain` can be implemented totally analogously:

$$STFL.language![39..42]!file
