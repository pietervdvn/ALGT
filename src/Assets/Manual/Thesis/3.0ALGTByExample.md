ALGT in a Nutshell
=====================

In this part, we present **ALGT**, a tool and language to describe both syntax and semantics of aribitrary programming languages.
This can be used to formally capture meaning of any language, formalizing them or, perhaps, gradualize them. 

To introduce the ALGT-language, a small functional language (STFL) is formalized, giving a clear yet practical overview. This way, using ALGT to define a language should be clear.

This chapter does _not_ give used command line arguments, an exhaustive overview of builtin functions, ... For this, we refer the reader to the tutorial and manual, which can be obtained by running `ALGT --manual-pdf`. This chapter neither gives algorithms used internally, such as the typechecker used on ALGT-languages, the proof searching algorithm, ... For these, we refer to the section about ALGT internals.

STFL
----

The _Simply Typed Functional Language_ (STFL) is a small, functional language supporting integers, addition, booleans, if-then-else constructions and lambda abstractions, as visible in the examples (figure \ref{fig:stflexamples}). Furthermore, variable declarations have a type, which can be `Bool`, `Int` or a function type. This typing is checked by a typechecker.

Due to its simplicity, it is widely used as example language in the field and thus well-understood throughout the community. This language will be gradualized in a later chapter.

 Skeleton
----------

A language is defined in a single `.language`-document, which is split in multiple sections: one for each aspect of the programming language. Each of these sections will be explored in depth. This results in a base skeleton of the language, as given below:

	STFL # Name of the language	
	****

	Syntax
	======

	# Syntax definitions

	Functions
	=========

	# Rewriting rules, small helper functions

	Relations
	=========

	# Declarations of which symbols are used

	Rules
	=====

	# Natural deduction rules, defining operational semantics or typechecker

	Properties
	==========

	# Automaticly checked properties


Syntax
------

The first step in formalizing a language is declaring _what the language looks like_, which is called the **syntax** of a language. Declaring the syntax can be done by writing BNF - a way to construct a context-free grammer. 
A context-free grammer can be used for two purposes: the first is creating all possible strings a language contains. On the other hand, the grammer can be used to deduce whether a given string is part of the language - and if it is, how this string is structured. This latter process is called _parsing_. ALGT can automatically construct a parser for the given BNF,  which will turn the flat source code into a structured parsetree.


### BNF

When formalizing a language syntax, the goal is to capture all possible strings that a program could be. This can be done with **production rules**. A production rule captures a _syntactic form_ (a sublanguage) and consists of a name, followed by on or more options. 
An option is a sequence of parts, a part is a literal string or the name of another syntactic form:

	nameOfRule	::= otherForm 
			| "literal" 
			| otherForm "literal" otherForm1 
			| ...


The syntactic form (or language) containing all boolean constants, can be captured with:

	bool		::= "True" | "False"

A language containing all integers has already been provided via a builtin. For practical reasons, it is given the name `int`: 

	int		::= Number

The syntactic form containing all additions of two terms can now easily be captured:

	addition	::= int "+" int

Syntactic forms can be declared recursively as well, to declare more complex additions:

	addition	::= int "+" addition

Note that some syntactic forms are not allowed (such as empty syntactic forms or left recursive forms), this is more detailed in section \ref{properties-of-the-syntax}.

### STFL-syntax

In this format, the entire syntax for STFL can be formalized using multiple syntactic forms. 

The first syntactic forms defined are types. Types are split into 

- basetypes, containing only `"Bool"` and "Int"
- typeterms, containing basetypes and types between parentheses,
- the full types, containing either a function type with an `"->"` or a typeterm

$$$stfl.language![13..15]!file

The builtin constants `True` and `False` are defined as earlier introduced:

$$$stfl.language!9!file


For integers and variables, the corresponding builtin values are used: 

$$$stfl.language![19..20]!file

`number` and `bool` together form `value`, the expressions which are in their most simple form:

$$$stfl.language!21!file

Another form term that can not be reduced any further is a bare lambda abstraction. A new syntacic form, `canon` is created, grouping all forms that can not be reduced any further:

$$$stfl.language!23!file


Expressions are split into terms (`eL`) and full expressions (`e`):

$$$stfl.language![24..32]!file


A typing environment is provided as well. This is not part of the language itself, but will be used when typing programs:


$$$stfl.language![38..39]!file



### Parsing

Parsing is the process of structuring an input string, to construct a parsetree.
This is the first step applied on a program in any compilation or interpretation process.

ALGT parses a target source code by trying to match a single syntactic form against the target program; eventually matching other subforms against parts of the input resulting in a parsetree.

When a string is parsed against syntactic form, the options in the definition of the syntactic form are tried, from left to right. The first option matching the string is used. An option, which is a sequence of either literals or other syntactic forms, is parsed by parsing element per element. A literal is parsed by comparing the head of the string to the literal itself, syntactic forms are parsed recursively.

In the case of `20 + 22` being parsed against `expr`, all the choices defining `expr` are tried, being `term "+" expr`, `term expr` and `term`. As parsing happens left to right, first `term "+" expr` is tried, implying the leftmost element of the sequence (`term`) is parsed with the string as input. 
After inspecting all the choices for term, the parser will use the last choice of term (`int`), which neatly matches `20`.
The remainder string is now `+ 22`, which should be parsed against the rest of the sequence, `"+" expr`. The `"+"` in the sequence is now next to be tried, which matches the head of the string. The last `22` is parsed against `expr`. In order to parse `22`, the last choice of `expr`, thus `int` is used.

The resulting parsetree can be found in figure \ref{fig:parsetrees}, together with some other examples.

This process is also denoted in figure \ref{fig:parsing}.

"22"		~ expr.0 (expr)
"22"		~ expr; expr.0 ()
...
"22"		~ term.3 (int) ; expr.2 (); expr.0 ()
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{The step-by-step parsing, based on a syntax definition; each line shows a step in the process. The first line gives the input string and syntactic form that it is parsed with. To parse \code{expr}, each of the choices is tried, the current choice being indicated with the index, the choice sequence written between parentheses. This sequence is parsed element per element; thus the first element of the sequence is moved on top of the stack. If the top element matches, the remainder string is shortened. If no element matches, the stack is popped and the next choice tried.}

### Conclusion

ALGT allows a concise yet accurate description of any language, through the use of BNF. This notation can then be interpreted in order to parse a target program file; resulting in the parsetree, a structure used to represent the target program. 


\clearpage

Metafunctions
-------------

Existing parsetrees can be modified or rewritten by using **metafunctions**[^termFunction]. A metafunction receives one or more parsetrees as input and generates a new parsetree based on the input and function definition. These metafunctions are Turing-complete, so could be used to state the typechecker or interpreter for the target language. However, natural deduction (introduced in the next chapter) is a more structural way to achieve this. The metafunctions are however still an excellent tool to create smaller _helper functions_.

[^termFunction]: In this section, we will also use the term _function_ to denote a _metafunction_. Under no condition, the term function refers to some entity of the target language.

Metafunctions have the following form:

	f : input1 -> input2 -> ... -> output
	f(pattern1, pattern2, ...)	= someParseTree
	f(pattern1', pattern2', ...)	= someParseTree'


The obligatory **signature** gives the name (`f`), followed by what syntactic forms the input parsetrees should have. The last element in the type[^syntacticType] signature is the syntactic form of the parsetree that the function should return. ALGT effectivily _typechecks_ functions, thus preventing the construction of parsetrees for which no syntactic form is defined.


[^syntacticType]: In this chapter, the term _type_ is to be read as _the syntactic form a parsetree has_. It has nothing to do with the types defined in STFL. Types as defined within STFL will be denoted with `type`.

The body of the functions consists of one or more **clauses**, containing one pattern for each input argument and an expression to construct the resulting parsetree.

**Patterns** have multiple purposes:

- First, they act as guard: if the input parsetree does not have the right form or contents, the match fails and the next clause in the function is activated. A pattern thus acts as an advanced `switch` of imperative languages.
- Second, they assign variables, which can be used to construct a new parsetree.
- Third, they can deconstruct large parsetrees, allowing finegrained pattern matching within the parsetrees' branches.
- Fourth, advanced searching and recombination behaviour is implemented in the form of evaluation contexts. This behaviour is explained and explored in section \ref{convergence}.


**Expressions** are the dual of patterns: where a pattern deconstructs, the expression does construct a parsetree; where the pattern assigns a variable, the expression will recall the variables value. Expressions are used on the right hand side of each clause, constructing the end result of the value.

An overview of all patterns and expressions can be found in the following tables:



| Expr				| As pattern			
|:------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------
$$$patternExamples


| Expr			| Name		|  As expression						
|:----------------------|:--------------|:-------------------------------------
$$$expressionExamples


### Domain and codomain

With these expressions and patterns, it is possible to make metafunctions extracting the domain and codomain of a function `type` (in STFL). These will be used in the typechecker in the following chapter. `domain` and `codomain` are defined in the following way:

$$$stfl.language![65..74]!file


Recall the parsetree generated by parsing `Int -> Bool` against `type`. If this parsetree were used as input into the `domain` function, it would fail to match the first pattern (as the parsetree does not contain parentheses) nor would it match the second pattern (again are parentheses needed). The third pattern matches, by assigning `T1` and `T2`, as can seen in figure \ref{fig:patternMatch1}. `T1` is extracted and returned by `domain`, which is, by definition the domain of the `type`.

\begin{figure}
\center
\includegraphics{TypeTrees0annot.png}
\caption{The pattern match of \code{Int -> Bool} against pattern \code{T1 "->" T2}, used in the \code{domain} function. The domain will be captured within \code{T1}}
\label{fig:patternMatch1}
\end{figure}

Analogously, the more advanced parsetree representing `Int -> Bool -> Bool` will be deconstructed the same way, as visible in figure \ref{fig:patternMatch2}, again capturing the domain within `T1`.


\begin{figure}
\center
\includegraphics{TypeTrees1annot.png}
\caption{The pattern match of \code{Int -> Bool -> Bool} against pattern \code{T1 "->" T2}, used in the \code{domain} function. The domain will again be captured within \code{T1}}
\label{fig:patternMatch2}
\end{figure}

The deconstructing behaviour of patterns can be observed when `(Int -> Bool) -> Bool` is used as argument for `domain`. It matches the second clause, deconstructing the part left of the arrow, namely `(Int -> Bool)`, and matching it against the embedded pattern `"(" T1 ")"`, as visualised in figure \ref{fig:patternMatch3}, capturing the domain _without parentheses_ in `T1`.

\begin{figure}
\center
\includegraphics{TypeTrees2annot1.png}
\caption{The variable assignment after pattern matching \code{(Int -> Bool) -> Bool} against pattern \code{("(" T1 ")") "->" T2}. The entire subpattern \code{"(" T1 ")"} is circled in green, where \code{T1} will again capture the domain.}
\label{fig:patternMatch3}
\end{figure}

### Equate

Another usefull function is `equate`, which compares two values for equality and is undefined if the values are not the same. Its implementation is the following:


	equate	: type -> type -> type
	equate(T, T)	= T

This function uses two patterns which bind the same variable, which is perfectly allowed. When the function is applied and the variable store is constructed, the pattern matcher will detect if a variable is bound to multiple values. If such a misbinding is detected, the pattern fails and falls through. If all arguments bound to the variable `T` are the same, the match succeeds.


### Safety checks

When the language is loaded by ALGT, the metafunctions are checked for possible errors:

- Patterns are typechecked, detecting invalid deconstructions
- Expressions are typechecked, preventing the construction of malformed parsetrees, thus parsetrees for which no syntactical definition exists
- The patterns are aggregated and ALGT checks that no pattern can fallthrough
- The aggregated patterns are checked that at least one argument combination can match the pattern, so that no clause is dead.

These checks catch many small inconsistencies the language designer might make, catching many bugs.

The checks catching liveness and fallthrough are explained in the chapter about abstract interpretation, in particular section \ref{combining-clauses}.

### Conclusion

Metafunctions give a concise, typesafe way to transform parsetrees. The many checks, such as wrong types, liveness and fallthrough perform the first sanity checks and catch many bugs beforehand.
