For this master dissertation, I would like to express my gratitude to the following persons, without whom this master dissertation would not have been possible:  
\newline
_Christophe Scholliers_, for offering interesting research topics, for requesting features I would have never thought of, for giving much needed advice on how to improve my writing skills, for making time in his busy life, for worrying about me when I was sick and generally for inspiring me.   
\newline
_The Faculty of Sciences_, for offering a varied set of fascinating courses which I enjoyed;   
\newline
_Ilion Beyst_, for always being enthousiastic about the entire tool, testing and abusing it in countless ways; and for always being up to date about the entire project, giving great advice;  
\newline
The members of _Zeus WPI_, for their general interest and allowing me to host a tutorial evening, where some members tried to create their own programming language;  
\newline
_Isaura Claeys_, for proofreading parts of the manual;  
\newline
_Rien Maertens_, for being an excellent rubber duck, quacking the writers block away;  
\newline
_Tom Schrijvers_, whom taught me to program in Haskell and let me discover the love for language design;   
\newline
And my family, for supporting me throughout the journey, often exclaiming they had no idea what I was talking about or for testing the tool.
