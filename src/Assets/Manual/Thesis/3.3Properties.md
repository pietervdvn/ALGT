Declaring and checking properties
---------------------------------

The third important aspect of a language, apart from syntax and semantics, are the properties it obeys. These properties offer strong guarantees about the language and semantics. In the next paragraphs, two important properties of STFL are stated and added to the language definition. ALGT will quickcheck them.

### Progress and Preservation

The first important guarantee is that a _well typed expression_ can always be evaluated. Without this property, called **Progress**, using a typechecker would be useless; as some well-typed expression would still crash or hang. Another important property, called **Preservation**, is that an expression of type `T` is still of type `T` after evaluation. While this property is not surprising, it is important to formally state this. Together, these properties imply that a well-typed expression can be evaluated to a new, well-typed expression of the same type.

As this is an important aspect as well, ALGT offers a way to incorporate these properties into the language definition. These properties are automatically checked by randomly generated examples or might be tested against an example program. Sadly, it is not possible to automatically proof arbitrary properties, so some cases for which the property does not hold might slip through.

### Stating Preservation

Preservation states that, _if an expression `e0` has type `T` and if `e0` can be evaluated to `e1`, then `e1` should be of type `T` too_. Note that all these conditions can be captured with the earlier definied relations: _if `e0 :: T` and `e0 → e1`, then `e1 :: T`_. This semantics are pretty close to a natural deduction rule with predicates, but instead of adding the consequent to the relation, checking whether the conclusion holds does suffice. 

The natural deduction rule syntax is thus reused to state properties:

$$$stfl.language![260..262]!file

### Stating Progress

Progress states that, _if an expression `e` can be typed (as type `T`), then `e` is either fully evaluated or `e` can be evaluated further_. This to can be stated in terms of the earlier defined relations: _if `e :: T`, then `e:value` or `e → e1`_.  

In order to denote the choice, a new syntax is introduced, using a `|` (a vertical bar). This syntax is not allowed in natural deduction rules defining relations. Furthermore, allowing predicates of the form `e:value` is another difference with the syntax used to define rules.

The property can be stated as:

$$$stfl.language![265..267]!file


### Testing properties

ALGT will test these properties automatically each time the language definition is loaded. In order to test a property, a testing sample of is generated, by calculating what inputs are needed for the property (the input for Preservation is `e0`, Progress needs `e` to be generated). For those inputs, parsetrees are randomly generated and the property is tested.

These properties offer an extra guarantee about the language created, again in a non-ambiguous and machine-checkable way, a feature increasing the language designers productivity.

It is possible to print those proofs, as given below:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=terminal]
# Property Preservation statisfied with assignment 
# {T --> Int, e0 --> 1 + 2, e1 --> 3}
  # Predicate satisfied:
  # e0 :: T
  
    1 : number               2 : number            
    ----------- [Tnumber]    ----------- [Tnumber] 
    {} ⊢ 1, Int              {} ⊢ 2, Int          
    -------------------------------------- [TPlus]
    {} ⊢ 1 + 2, Int
    ---------------------------------- [TEmptyCtx]
    1 + 2 :: Int
  
  # Predicate satisfied:
  # e0 → e1
  
    1 : Number    2 : Number
    ------------------------ [EvalPlus]
    1 + 2 → 3
  
  
  
  # Satisfies a possible conclusion:
  # e1 :: T
  
  3 : number
  ----------- [Tnumber]
  {} ⊢ 3, Int
  --------------------- [TEmptyCtx]
  3 :: Int
  
  
Property Progress holds for given examples
Property successfull
# Property Progress statisfied with assignment {T --> Int, e0 --> 1 + 2}
  # Predicate satisfied:
  # e0 :: T
  
    1 : number               2 : number              
    ----------- [Tnumber]    ----------- [Tnumber]  
    {} ⊢ 1, Int              {} ⊢ 2, Int         
    -------------------------------------- [TPlus]
    {} ⊢ 1 + 2, Int
    ---------------------------------- [TEmptyCtx]
    1 + 2 :: Int
  
  
  
  # Satisfies a possible conclusion:
  # e0 → e1
  
  1 : Number    2 : Number
  ------------------------ [EvalPlus]
  1 + 2 → 3
\end{lstlisting}[style=terminal]
  


Conclusion
----------

ALGT allows a versatile, human readable and portable format to define programming languages, supporting a wide range of operations, such as parsing, running and typechecking target languages. On top, properties about the language in general can be stated and tested. 

Each funcamental aspect of the language is given his place, giving rise to a formally correct and machine-checkable language definition. No ambiguities can possibly exist, creating a highly exchangable format. By keeping the focus on readability, no host-language boiler plate should be learned on written, creating a language agnostic tool to exchange new programming languages.
