Natural deduction 
-----------------

In this section, the syntactic forms of STFL are given meaning by rewriting a parsetree to its canonical form. After a short exposure on different ways to inject semantics to a program, operational semantics are implemented for STFL.

### Giving meaning to a program

In section \ref{describing-semantics}, a definition of semantics and multiple approaches to describing them were given.

Recall that the meaning of a program is the effect that it has on the world. Four frameworks to specify semantics were described: 

- Translation to another language
- Denotational semantics
- Axiomatic semantics
- Structural operational semantics

While all of the above semantical approaches are possible within ALGT, structural operational semantics (or operational semantics for short) is the easiest and most practical approach for this dissertation.
The main ingredient, the syntax of the language, is already present; only the transformations of the parsetree should be denoted. As STFL is a functional language, there is no need for a state to be modeled.


### Semantics as relations

All these semantics, especially structural operational semantics, are relations:

- Translation and denotational semantics revolves around the relation between two languages
- Structural operational semantics for functional languages revolves around the relation between two expressions - the original expression and the expression after evaluation
- Operational semantics for an imperative program revolves around the relation around the state before, a statement and a state after.
- Axiomatic semantics relate the properties before and after execution of an imperatie

All these relations can be constructed using natural deduction rules in a straightforward and structured way. The most 

In the rest of this chapter, natural deduction is used to construct a structur semantic for STFL, followed by a typechecker.



### Declaring relations


_Smallstep_ is the relation between STFL-expressions, which ties an expression to another expression which is smaller, but has the same value. As example, smallstep rewrites expressions as `1 + 1` into `2` or `If True Then 41 + 1 Else 0` into `41 + 1`.
This relation will be denoted with the symbol `→`. As this relation is between two expressions, it lies within `expr × expr`.


Defining this relation within ALGT is done in two steps. First, the relation is declared in the `Relations`-section, afterwards the implementation is given in the `Rules` section.

The declaration of smallstep in ALGT is as following:

$$$stfl.language![106..107],112!file

Lines 1 and 2 give the `Relation`-header, indicitating that the following lines will contain relation declarations. The actual declaration is in line 4. 

First, the symbol for the relation is given, between parentheses: `(→)`. Then, the types of the arguments are given, by `: expr (in), expr (out)`, denoting that `→` is a relation in `expr × expr`.
Each argument has a mode, one of `in` or `out`, written between parentheses. This is to help the tool when proving the relation: given `1 + 1` as first argument, the relation can easily deduce that this is rewritten to `2`. However, given `2` as second argument, it is hard to deduce that this was the result of rewriting `1 + 1`, as there are infinitely many expressions yielding `2`.

Relations might have one, two or more arguments, of which at least one should be an input argument[^inputArguments]. Relations with no output arguments are allowed, an example of this would be a predicate checking for equality.

[^inputArguments]: There is no technical restriction forcing a relation to have at least one input argument. However, a relation with only output arguments will always have exactly the same output. Such a thing is called _a constant_ and can be written _without_ a relation. This renders a relation with only input arguments quite useless.

The last part, `Pronounced as "smallstep"` is documentation. It serves as human readable name, hinting the role of the relation within the language for users of the programming language which are not familiar with commonly used symbols. While this is optional, it is strongly recommended to write: it gives a new user a prononciation for the relation and, even more important, a term which can be searched for in a search engine. Symbols are notoriously hard to search.

### Natural deduction rules

The declaration of a relation does not state anything about the actual implementation of this relation. This implementation is given by natural deduction rules. Each natural deduction rule focuses on a single aspect of the relation. In this sections, how to construct natural deduction rules is explained in detail.

#### Simple natural deduction rules

A simple natural deduction rule is given to ALGT in the following form:




	---------------------------------- [Rule0Name]
         (relation) arg0, arg1, arg2, ...


The relation can also be written in an infix way:


	---------------------------------- [Rule0Name]
         arg0 relation arg1, arg2, ...


The most important part of a rule is written below the line, which states that `(arg0, arg1, arg2, ...)` is in `relation`. The arguments can be advanced patterns/expressions, just as seen with functions. The expression on an input argument location is treated as a pattern, which will match the input parsetree and construct a variable store. Expressions on output argument locations use this variable store to construct the output. This is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:applicationExample}, where a rule introduced in figure \ref{fig:ruleExample} is used.

#### Natural deduction rules with predicates


In some cases, extra conditions apply before a tuple is part of a relation. Extra conditions could be that:

- Two parsetrees should be the same, or two parts in a parsetree should be the same
- A parsetree should be of a certain syntacic form
- Some relation between the arguments should hold.

This can be forced by using predicates, which are written above the line seperated by tab characters:

	 (rel) arg1 arg2	arg0:form	arg0 = arg2
	------------------------------------------------------ [Rule1Name]
         (relation) arg0, arg1, arg2, ...

This rules is pronounced as _ if `(rel) arg1, arg2` holds, if `arg0` is a `form` and `arg0 = arg2`, then `(relation) arg0, arg1, arg2` holds.


Predicates are evaluated from left to right, where a relation predicate might introduce new variables in the variable store. This information flow is illustrated in \ref{fig:predicateExample}.

Each of the predicates is tested with this state in a left to right fashion.
The last predicate, $\code{e0 $~>$ e1}$ applies rule \emph{ExampleRule} with $\code{e0}$ as input argument and $\code{e1}$ as unbound variable, as seen in \ref{fig:applicationExample}.
This results in $\code{e1}$ to be introduced in the state and $\code{e1}$ to be bound to the resulting value, namely $\code{"42"}$.
This is used to construct the output argument.}

### Defining smallstep


With these tools introduced in the previous chapter, it is feasible to define _smallstep_. Each facet of this relation will be described by a single natural deduction rule.

Remember that smallstep rewrites a small piece of a parsetree in the smallest possible amount. In other words, for each syntactic form, a the simplification will be given. This does not guarantee that the parsetree is fully evaluated; rather, smallstep only makes the tree _smaller_ while preserving its value.

Deduction rules for the following syntacic forms are given:

- If-expressions
- Parentheses
- Addition
- Type ascription
- Lambda abstraction and application

Furthermore, a convergence rule for nested expressions is added.

#### If-then-else and parentheses

For starters, the rule evaluating `If True Then ... Else ...` can be easily implemented:

$$$stfl.language![149..151]!file

This rule states that `("If" "True" "Then" e1 "Else" e2, e1)` is an element of the relation `→`. In other words, _`"If" "True" "Then" e1 "Else" e2` is rewritten to `e1`_.

Analogously, the case for `False` is implemented:


$$$stfl.language![153..155]!file


Another straightforward rule is the removal of parentheses:

$$$stfl.language![145..147]!file


#### Addition

The rule `EvalPlus` reduces the syntactic form `n1 "+" n2` into the actual sum of the numbers, using the builtin function `!plus`. However, this builtin function can only handle `Number`s; a parsetree containing a richer expression can't be handled by `!plus`. This is why two additional predicates are added, checking that `n1` and `n2` are of syntactic form `Number`.

$$$stfl.language![135..137]!file


#### Type ascription

Type ascription is the syntactic form checking that an expression is of a certain type. If this is the case, evaluation continues with the nested evaluation. If not, the execution of the program halts.

As predicate, the typechecker defined in the next part is used, which is denoted by the relation `(::)`. This relation infers, for a given `e`, the corresponding type `T`. The rule is defined as following:


	 e  ::  T
	------------------------		[EvalAscr]
	 e "::" T → e



In order to gradualize this language later on, a self-defined equality relation is used. This equality `==` will be replaced with _is consistent with_ `~` when gradualizing, resulting in:

$$$stfl.language![141..143]!file


#### Applying lambdas

The last syntactic form to handle are applied lambda abstractions, such as `(x : Int . x + 1) 41`. The crux of this transformation lies in the substitution of the variable `x` by the argument everywhere in the body. Substitution can be done with the builtin function `!subs`.

The argument should have the expected type, for which the predicate `arg :: T` is added. The argument should also be fully evaluated in order to have strict semantics. This is checked by the predicate `arg:value`, giving the rule:

$$$stfl.language![158..160]!file


#### Convergence


There is still a problem with the relation for now: the given evaluation rules can't handle nested expressions, such as `1 + (2 + 39)`.
No rule exists yet which would evaluate this expression to `1 + 41`.

It is rather cumbersome to introduce rules for each position where a syntactic form might be reduced. For `+`, this would need two extra rules (`e0 "+" e → e1 "+" e` and `e "+" e0 → e "+" e1`), `If`-expressions would need an additional three rules, ... This clearly does not scale. 

A scaling solution is the following convergence rule:

$$$stfl.language![129..131]!file

This rule uses an _evaluation context_: `e[e0]`. This pattern will capture the entire input as `e` and search a subtree matching the nested expression `e0` _fullfilling all the predicates_. In this case, an `e0` is searched so that `e0` can be evaluated to `e1`. 

When the evaluation context `e[e1]` is used to construct a new parsetree (the output argument), the original parsetree `e` is modified. Where the subtree `e0` was found, the new value `e1` is plugged back, as visible in figure \ref{fig:hole}.

\begin{figure}[h]

#### Overview

The semantics of the STFL language can be captured in 7 straightforward natural deduction rules, in a straightforward and human readable format. For reference, these rules are:

$$$stfl.language![123..125],[129..160]!file

The relation `→` needs a single input argument, so it might be run against an example expression, such as `1 + 2 + 3`.

$$$($$$stfl.language $$$Examples.stfl!7 -l e -r → --nc)

Running `→` over a lambda abstraction gives the following result:

$$$($$$stfl.language $$$Examples.stfl!8 -l e -r → --nc)
