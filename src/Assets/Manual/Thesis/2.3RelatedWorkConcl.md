Conclusion
----------

While all tools are usefull, no tool fills the needs of our dissertation. Some of the tools, such as Yacc and Antlr, only focus on the actual parsing of the target language. Some other tools, such as XText or LLVM fill in other needs, such as tooling support or low-level code compilation.

PLT-redex is an excellent tool for formal language design, altough it lacks support for gradual languages. On the other hand, the Gradualizer helps gradualizing languages, but is hard to use and restricted to small languages.

No tool allows both easy design of programming languages and gradualization of them. In this disseration, a new tool named ALGT is introduced which allows both.
