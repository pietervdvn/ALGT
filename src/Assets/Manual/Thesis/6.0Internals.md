# Implementation of ALGT

In this chapter, the codebase of ALGT is explored. All important technical choices are given, making a reimplementation of core-ALGT possible: the representation of the syntax, functions and natural deduction rules; together with their usage: the parser and interpreters for functions and rules. The algorithms are accompanied with Haskell-snippets or pseudocode, so some familiarity with basic haskell is required for this chapter. These illustrate the algorithms, but are often simplified. Complications for additional features, often conceptually simple yet tremendously practical, are omitted.

This chapter does not cover the abstract interpretation; these algorithms are already explained in detail in chapter \ref{syntax-driven-abstract-interpretation}.


## Representation and parsing of arbitrary syntax

The first aspect of any programming language is its syntax. ALGT allows to denote these explicitly, on which a parser can be based as can be seen in \ref{stfl-syntax}. Of course, the BNF has a representation within ALGT, which is given by the following construct:

\begin{lstlisting}
-- Representation of a single BNF-expression
data BNF 	= Literal String	-- Literally parse 'String'
		| BNFRuleCall Name	-- Parse the rule with the given name.
		| BNFSeq [BNF]		-- Sequence of parts
\end{lstlisting}

The most fundamental element here is the `Literal`, which is the terminal given in the string. Calling a non-terminal or builtin value is represented with `BNFRuleCall`. By using external definitions for the builtins, the main representation can be kept small and clean. At last, single elements can be glued together using `BNFSeq`.

All these expressions are bundled into a syntax:

\begin{lstlisting}
{-Represents a syntax: the name of the rule + possible BNFS -}
data Syntax	= BNFRules 
			{ bnf 		:: Map TypeName [BNF]
			, lattice 	:: Lattice TypeName
			}
\end{lstlisting}

All the syntactic forms are saved into the dictionary `bnf`, which contains a mapping from the name of the non-terminal onto all possible choices for that syntactic form. As a syntacic form also is a type for the metafunctions, this dictionary also doubles as store for known types.

 The second responsibility of the syntax is keeping track of the supertyping-relationship. The lattice-data structure keeps track of what type is a subtype of what other types and will play a major role in the typechecker.

### Target language parsing

A syntax as above can be interpreted as a program, acting on an input string generating a parsetree. The parser, which uses the _Parsec_-package in the background, is constructed recursively as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:parser}.

The entry point for the parser is `parseNonTerminal`, which takes the name of the rule that should be parsed - together with the syntax itself. In this syntax, the relevant choices are searched. These choices are tried one by one in `parseChoices`. The actual parsing in `parseChoices` is delegated to `parsePart`, which does the actual interpretation: tokens (`Literal`) are parsed literally, sequences (`BNFSeq`) are parsed using `parsePart` recursively. If a non-terminal (`RuleCall`) is encountered, `parsePart` calls `parseNonTerminal`, closing the loop. 

\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}

-- Seaches the given rule in the syntax, tries to parse it
parseNonTerminal	:: Syntax -> Name -> Parser ParseTree
parseNonTerminal syntax@(BNFRules syntForms _) ruleToParse wsModeParent
 | ruleToParse `M.notMember` syntForms	
		= fail $ ruleToParse++" is not defined in the given syntax"
 | otherwise	= do	let choices	= syntForms ! ruleToParse
			parseChoice syntax ruleToParse choices 




-- Search one of the choices that can be parsed
parseChoices	:: Syntax -> Name -> [BNF] -> Parser ParseTreeLi
parseChoices _ ruleToParse _ []
	-- All choices depleted, can not parse anything
	= fail $ "Could not parse expression of the form "++ruleToParse
parseChoices syntax ruleToParse  (choice:rest)
	= try (parsePart syntax choice)
	   <|>  parseChoices syntax name  rest




-- Parses a single BNF-part
parsePart	:: Syntax -> BNF -> Parser ParseTree

-- Parse exactly the literal str
parsePart _ tp _ (Literal str)
		= do	string str
			return $ MLiteral str

-- Parse a rulecall...
parsePart syntax _  bnf@(BNFRuleCall ruleToParse)
 | isBuiltin bnf
		= do	let parser	= getParserForBuiltin bnf
			parsedStr	<- parser
			return $ MLiteral parsedStr
 | otherwise		-- call another non-terminal recursively
		= parseNonTerminal rules ruleToParse wsMode

-- degenerate case for sequences: a sequence with a single element
parsePart syntax (BNFSeq [bnf])
		= parsePart syntax tp  bnf

-- parse all elements of the sequence in order
parsePart syntax (BNFSeq (bnf:bnfs))
		= do	head	<- parsePart syntax tp  bnf
			tail	<- bnfs |+> parsePart' syntax tp  
			return $ PtSeq (head:tail)


\end{lstlisting}
\caption{The recursively constructed parser. \code{MLiteral} and \code{PtSeq} are part of the target program representation and explained in \ref{target-program-representation}}
\label{fig:parser}
\end{figure}

## Target program representation

Target programs are represented as _parsetrees_. The data structure responsible is structured as following:

\begin{lstlisting}
data ParseTreeA
	= MLiteral 	{ptaContents :: String}
	| MInt		{ptaInt :: Int}	
	| PtSeq		{ptaPts :: [ParseTreeA]}	
\end{lstlisting}

This implementation falls apart in the concrete values (`MLiteral` for strings and `MInt` for numbers) and a node to combine parts into longer sequences: `PtSeq`. `PtSeq` acts as node element in the parsetree, whereas the concrete values are the branches.

In the actual implementation more information is tracked in the parsetree, such as what syntactic form constructed the parsetree, the starting position of each token and its lengh. For clarity, this extra information is omitted in this text.

The string `(1 + 2)` -when parsed with `e` from STFL- is represented by the parsetree  
`PtSeq [MLiteral "(", PtSeq [MLiteral "1", MLiteral "+", MLiteral "2"], MLiteral ")" ]`.  
Its graphical representation can be seen in figure \ref{fig:simpleSum}
