## Relations

The last major feature of ALGT are the interpreter for relations. Per its declaration, has a relation one or more arguments, of which some input- and some output-arguments. The implementation of a relation consists of multiple natural deduction rules. These rules, reusing the patterns/expressions introduced for metafunctions, are represented internally with the following data type:

\begin{lstlisting}
data Predicate	= 
	  -- Predicates as `x : type`
	  TermIsA Name TypeName
	  -- Predicates as `x --> y`
	| Needed RelationName [Expression]

data Rule	= Rule 
	{ -- The name of the rule, for documentation reasons only
	  ruleName 	:: Name
	  -- The predicates that the rule should fullfill
	, rulePreds 	:: [Predicate]
	  -- The arguments to the relation it proves
	, ruleConcl	:: [Expression]
	}
\end{lstlisting}

With a representation for rules, relationships are represented as following:

\begin{lstlisting}

data Relation = Relation
	{ relationName	:: Name
	-- Input/output modes of the arguments, as declared
	, modes		:: [Mode]
	-- Types of the arguments, as declared
	, types		:: [TypeName]
	-- The rules implementing the relation
	, rules		:: [Rule]
	}
\end{lstlisting}

### Typechecking

Typechecking relations is straightforward as well, the basic building block is already introduced in \ref{typechecker-of-expressions}. As the type of each argument is already known, each expression in the conclusion of the rule can be annotated with types straightforwardly.

### Building proof of a relation

With an overview of all rules and the relations that are implemented with them, it is possible to construct a proof that certain arguments $a_1, a_2, \ldots $ are part of a relationship $R$. Proving a relationship boils down to trying to proof any rule of the relationship with the given arguments; if such a rule is found, it is noted what rule is used. It might be possible that multiple rules provide a proof for some input argument, indiciting that a conclusion can be proven by multiple means. This is fine as long as the conclusion reached by the multiple rules is the same; but when the output arguments diverge, an error message is generated.

Proving a rule involves proving the predicates as well; this might involve proving another relation recursively.

The entire algorithm can be found as simplified pseudocode in figure \ref{fig:prover}

\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=algo]

proofRelation(relationName, inputArguments):
	possibleRules	= relations.rulesFor(relationName)
	foundProofs	= []
	for rule in possibleRules:
		proof	= proofRule(rule, inputArguments)
		if(proof.successfull()):
			foundProofs += proof
	
	if(divergentConclusions(foundProofs)):
		fail "Divergent proofs"

	# The shortest proof is selected
	# This is merely cosmetically to keep the proof sizes as small as possible
	return shortestProof(foundProofs)
	



# Proofs a single rule for the given arguments
proofRule(rule, inputArguments):
	expressions	= rule.getExpressions()
	predicates	= rule.getPredicates
	inArgs	= zip inputArguments ruleExpressions.inputExpressions()
	variableTable
		= patternMatchAll(inArgs)

	# Proofs for the predicates
	proofs	= []
	for predicate in predicates:
	    # Proof each predicate in order; this might update the variableTable
	    (variableTable, proof) = proofPredicate(variableTable, predicate)
	    # If the predicate fails to be proven, then the rule proving fails too
	    if(!proof.successfull):
		fail "Predicate could not be proven"
	    proofs	+= proof

	return proofs
	


# Proof a single predicate
proofPredicate(variableTable, predicate):
	case predicate of
	    # Proof a relation
	    # evaluate the arguments given and pass them to proofRelation
	    Needed relationName expressions:
		proofRelation(relationName,
			evaluateAll(expressions, variableTable))

	    # Check that the variable is of type type
	    TermIsA variable typename:
		if(variableTable.get(variable).type <: typename):
		    return success
		else:
		    fail "Incorrect type"
\end{lstlisting}

### Proving a relation with evaluation contexts

The searching behaviour of the evaluation context complicates the proving algorithm. To prove a typical convergence rule as `EvalCtx` (figure \ref{fig:evalCtxRepr}), a very specific `e0` is needed: one that can be reduced. This means that the pattern matching - where the subtree is searched - needs knowledge of the future predicates and should take these into account. The future predicates too are passed into the pattern matcher to achieve this. We omit the full details of this technicality, as that would take us to far, interested readers are refered to the source code available on github - ALGT is available on both the UGent and public repositories.

\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
    e0 → e1
--------------- [EvalCtx]
 e[e0] → e[e1]
\end{lstlisting}

## Further reading

The above code highlights the core features and algorithms of ALGT. This overview is far from complete: quite some practical features are omitted, apart from the many parts needed to make a usefull program (such as the language source parser, the command line parameter parser, the refactor support, ...)
