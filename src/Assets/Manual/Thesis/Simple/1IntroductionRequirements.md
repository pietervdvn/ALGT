 Building and Gradualizing programming languages
=================================================



Computers are complicated machines.

Programming them is hard.

To cope with this complexity, programming languages have been designed.

Designing programming languages is hard too.

No unified solution capturing all aspects of programming languages exists - Till today!



Programming is still hard.

To cope with this, typesystems have been designed.

Designing typesystems is hard too.

This tool can represent typesystems just as well!

And we can automatically check some properties!




Programming is hard, typesystems can be annoyingly picky sometimes.

Dynamic systems don't have this, but don't offer those checks.

Gradual systems let the programmer choose what to statically type, and what not.

Parts that are statically typed still have the same guarantees.

Parts that are dynamic might crash halfway through. But hey! No annoying checks!



Designing gradual typesystems is very hard.

Someone (Ronald Garcia) made some nice paper about it.

We try to apply as much as possible automatically.
