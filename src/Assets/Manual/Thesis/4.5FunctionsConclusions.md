Conclusion
----------

The techniques presented allow metafunctions to be lifted to functions over sets automatically. The framework for abstract interpretation gives a mathematical underpinning, whereas the compact representation and efficient operations ensure the practicallity and computablitiy, even in the face of infinite sets. 

Not only is this a crucial step in the gradualization of the target language, quite some checks can be implemented warning the programmer for missed cases. Lifting functions to functions over sets is thus a powerfull technique that can be applied broadly.
