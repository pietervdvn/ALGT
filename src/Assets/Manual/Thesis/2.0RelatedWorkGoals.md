========================

As _Programming Language Design_ starts to take of as a major field within computer sciences, tools are surfacing which formally define programming languages. All of these tools are created within their own timeframe and goals in mind. In this chapter, we explore what aspects are important for language designers, thus giving the goals for such a tool. Then, we investigate what tools already exist in this space.


Goals and nongoals
------------------

The ultimate goal should be to create a common language for language design, as this would increase formalization of language design. To gain widespread adoption, there should be as little barriers as possible, in installation, usage and documentation. It should be easy for a newcomer to use, without hindering the expressive power or available tools used by the expert.

### Tooling

Practical aspects are important - even the greatest tools lose users over unecessary barriers.

The first potential barrier is **installation** - which should be as smooth as possible. New users are easily scared by a difficult installation process, fleeing to other tools hindering adoption. 
Preferably, the tool should be availabe in the package repos. If not, installation should be as easy as downloading and running a single binary. Dependencies should be avoided, as these are often hard to deploy on the dev machine - they might be hard to get, to install, having version conflicts with other tools on the machine, not being supported on the operating system of choice...

The second important feature is **documentation**. Documentation should be easy to find, free, and preferably be distrubeted alongside the binary.

Thirdly, we'll also want to be **cross-platform**.
While most of the PL community uses a Unix-machine, other widely used, non-free operating systems should be supported as well.

As last, extra features like **syntax highlighting**, **automated tests** or having editor support for the target language is a nice touch. Most research tools also offer a **typesetting** module, which give a \LaTeX-version of the language.


### Metalanguage

The most important part is the metalangue itself - the major interface the language designer will use.

As language design itself is already difficult to grasp, we want the metalanguage to be **simple and easy**. There are some aspects which help to achieve this.

An easy language should be:

- As **focused** as possible, with little boilerplate. The core concepts of language design should have a central place.
- **Expressive** enough to be usefull
- As **simple** as possible, thus having little elements and special constructs. Each construction should be learned by the user; and each construction should be accounted for when doing automatic reasoning or transformations of the language.
- **Checked** as much as possible for big and small errors and report these errors with a clear error message.

#### Embedded DSL versus a new standalone language

Such a tool can be implemented as library (or domain specific language) embedded in anohter programming language. The other option is creating a totally new programming language, with a standalone interpreter or compiler.

Implementing the tool as library in a host language gives us a headstart, as all of the builtin functionality and optimazations can be used.
However, the cost later on is high. Starting with a fresh language has quite some benefits:

- The user does not have to deal with the host language at all. As embedded library, the language designer is forced either learning the new programming language (which takes a lot of time) or ignoring the native bits, and never having a full grasp of his creation. 
- By creating a fresh language, its syntax can be streamlined on what is needed: boilerplate can be avoided, making the language more fun to use.
- By not using a host language, analysises on metafunctions become possible. Because the metalanguage is small, well understood and explicitly represented in a data structure, it can be modified. This would be hard using a modern host language, as this would involve knowledge of the inner workings of the host language compiler. This is a futile effort, as modern compilers span over 100'000 lines of code (the Glasgow Haskell Compiler has around 140'000 lines of code \cite{GHCSize}). 
- No host compiler or toolchain has to be installed, skipping another dependency.

### Parsing the target language

The first step in defining the target language is declaring the syntax, for which the de facto standard has been _BNF_ since its introduction in the ALGOL-report. BNF is well-known to language designers and thus both the theoritical and practical aspects are well understood.
Furthermore, it is easy to port existing languages; often a BNF is already available for this language. 

A drawback is that many variants of BNF exist, such as EBNF \cite{WirthEBNF}, ABNF \cite{ABNF}, ... Each of these variants have their own extra features, such as constructions for repetition or builtin basic forms.
This is only superficial though: the underlying structure remains the same,  simple search-and-replace can convert one dialect into another.

A new tool should thus use some form of BNF to declare the syntax, eventually with small differences which streamline the syntax even more, but with little extra features in order to simplify automatic reasoning[^sugar].

[^sugar]: Some of these extra features could be implemented as syntactic sugar.

No other lower-level details should be exposed to the language designer, parsing should be possible only using the BNF. The language designer should not have to deal with tokenization, the parser itself or the internal definition of the parsetree - this should all be builtin and hidden.


### Executing the target language

A major goals is, of course, executing the targat programming language. 
There are multiple ways to do this, which raises the question which one is best suited for prototyping languages. The concerns prototyping languages are:

- **Correctness** of the programming language, no matter how the runtime semantics are declared.
- **Immediate and helpfull feedback**: when starting the program, error messages or output should be delivered as soon as possible.
- **Write once, run anywhere**: running target programs should behave the same on all systems.
- **Traceable**: it should be possible to see how program execution goes exactly, step by step, as to easily debug.

Explecit _nongoals_ for the tool are:

- Running the target program fast. Special efforts optimizing the target language are out of scope, a small and simple implementation is favored.
- Compiling executables for any platform. Creating target binaries is not necessary for this research.

This does point in the direction of building an interpreter for the programming language. 

### Typechecking the target language

If desired, a typechecker for the target language should be constructable as well. Preferably, no new metalanguage should be used to construct this algorithm. In other words, the typechecker should be build using the same linguistic metaconstructions as the interpreter.

Furthermore, **automatic correctness tests**  should be added, which checks the typechecker in conjunction with interpreter.
