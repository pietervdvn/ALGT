 Introduction
==============

Ever wanted to __create your own programming language__? This document shows you, how to create your own programming language, from scratch. A simple programming language can be up and running in about an hour time.

No previous experience with program language design is needed.

This tutorial will walk you through all the steps necessary to create your a simple language.

 - First, you'll create the syntax of your language - what it'll look like. This is explained in section [Declaring the syntax]
 - Second, we'll define some functions to calculate domain and codomain in section [Functions](functions)
 - Thirdly, we'll run the programs, using [Natural deduction relations](relations-and-rules-building-the-evaluator)
 - We can easily build a typechecker, as demonstrated in [the next chapter](building-the-typechecker]
 - We add some [properties] that can be tested against our typechecker and evaluator
 - As bonus, we provide fancy colors to our language, with [syntax-styling] and rendering to HTML and LaTeX


Those searching specific details (such as which builtin-functions exists, how whitespace-sensitive languages can be parsed, ...) can wander over to the second part, the [reference manual].

The last page is dedicated to [Unicode Characters], as these return quite often.

This manual is about version **$$version** (`$$versionmsg`), generated on $$date .
