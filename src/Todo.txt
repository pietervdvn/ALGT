Fix abstract interpretatie voor concretizatie + abstractie + domain


No matches for [Tx]
	Prob Cause: merging of vars is conservative (for function analysis) but should be liberal for rule analysis and possible matches

Why is --ira broken?

Consider
	arith	::= "(" arith ")" | int
	expr	::= "(" expr ")" | arith

THis should give an error, as "(" 5 ")" can be parsed as both arith and expr

Allow Number (upper case) as type for functions and relations

Fix a = b : type: remove typing

Usage of whitespace in bnf expressions should give a warning if used within a non-whitespace sensitive rule
